# Backend - API Implementation for Launch-Pizza
<br/>

To run
```bash
$ cd Launch_Pad_Practice
$ npm start
```

**APIs in the users.js file**

Used **users** and **menu** arrays to store all users' information and pizzas available in the menu respectively to act as the fake database. In reality, we should store and get the data from database.
